To Do:

Upload the completed code I wrote onto Git Hub
Upload Photos/Diagrams of actual Schematic
Develop some type of case/housing or at least a carry system
Test limitations of output to LCD
Order new components for planned upgrades
Find a better workflow from Arduino IDE to Github
Look into GitHub Desktop Pros/Cons
Modify output to calculate day - obtain RTC module
Acquire back up modules
Consider soldering for a more durable (and less temporary) set up
